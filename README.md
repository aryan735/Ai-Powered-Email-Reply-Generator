# Ai-Powered Email Reply Generator

This project aims to build an AI-powered email reply generator that can automatically generate email responses based on the content of the incoming email. The generator uses natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze the email content and craft appropriate replies, saving time and effort for users.

## Features

- AI-Driven Reply Generation: Automatically generate email replies based on the incoming message's content.
- Customizable Templates: Choose from pre-defined response templates or let the AI generate replies.
- Natural Language Processing: Utilize advanced NLP models to understand and interpret email content.
- Easy-to-Use Interface: A simple interface to interact with the application.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: 
  - Java
  - Spring Boot
  - NLP model (for AI reply generation)
  
- Frontend:
  - React
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- [JDK 8+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (for managing Java dependencies)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryan735/Ai-Powered-Email-Reply-Generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the **Ai-Code-Analyzer-Backend** directory:

   ```bash
   cd Ai-Code-Analyzer-Backend
   ```

3. Build the backend project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the Spring Boot application:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The backend should now be running locally on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the **CodeAnalyzer-frontend** directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../CodeAnalyzer-frontend
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Upon starting the backend and frontend, you can enter the content of an email into the interface.
- The AI will analyze the content and generate an appropriate email reply.
- You can choose to send the generated reply or modify it further.
